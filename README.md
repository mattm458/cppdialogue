# CppDialogue: A spoken dialogue system for C++

This is a work-in-progress repository. While it is intended to contain the building blocks for an aritficial spoken dialogue system, it is also a general-purpose library for performing stream processing, with each processor operating in parallel. It is based on an earlier similar project [JDialogue](https://github.com/mattm458/jdialogue), but rewritten in C++. This was done to avoid garbage collector overhead, and because I'm not sure of the status of PyTorch's Java bindings.
